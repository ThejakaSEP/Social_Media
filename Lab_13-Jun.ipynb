ChatGPT is an AMAZING tool and while it&#39;s not 100% accurate all of the time, with patience and better prompting you can do some pretty cool things with it. Personally I think Programmers should be worried, especially if a non programmer is able to develop workable code that does exactly as they envisioned it with ZERO knowledge and the only prequisite being the use of common sense when issues arise. This is just the START of AI, future iterations will 100% do away with the need for programmers.\n",

      "Comment: I look at software tools as a series of increasing levels of abstraction and decreasing levels of skill necessary to use them. You started out with machine code.  It might even have been wires on a plug board. The 1&#39;s and 0&#39;s entered into specific memory addresses. Then IBM Hollerith Punch cards or paper tape to load code. The assemblers came along to create machine code. Much faster and easier. Then higher-level languages came along and were even easier.  The skills needed to use higher level languages became less and less at the higher levels of abstraction. There are people who can program in Python that can&#39;t write or read machine code. Of course, object-oriented programming is all the rage.  No need to know how to create all those fancy data structures. ChatGPT will just be a higher level of abstraction that requires less detailed knowledge to use. Do you know why there is a language of mathematics? Because English is ambiguous and imprecise. Some level of computer language will be around for a long while.\n",

      "Comment: No.  Systems are becoming more intricate and complex as time goes on.  Human systems are vast and complex.  Microservices, Edge, API, Auth, DB, etc, etc.  Jr developers complain because there&#39;s so much to understand.  You really think an AI is going to be able to ingest all that?  Maybe one day, but not for at least another 20 years.  AI will make developers much more productive, but it won&#39;t decrease teams.  It&#39;s just the developers will be able to iterate their product features faster and refactor the technical debt out of codebases better.  So we&#39;ll see better stability and customer satisfaction.  I&#39;m sure you will see companies with 0 devs and someone trying to write spec sheets.  But it&#39;ll go no where and unless they have domain knowledge of a dozen different areas, there&#39;s only so much 1 person can do.  LMAO.  ChatGPT won&#39;t replace the complex jobs.  Monkey jobs?  Like those found in Buzzfeed news for sure...\n",

      "Comment: As of now LLMs that write code are like low skill interns that do tiny code generation that needs to be supervised by actual developers. It needs to be guided along and it needs a lot of help to be integrated into an actual project. It is very impressive don&#39;t get me wrong, but it&#39;s no where near human replacement and I don&#39;t see it changing drastically anytime soon.<br>Programming, unlike other activities, needs a lot of contextual understanding. It is on the opposite side of the spectrum from highly specialized activities like digital illustration. We saw the latter being perfected already. I&#39;m going to say that AI will be capable of doing the former sort of activities LAST and the latter first. Especially things like game dev requite so much unrelated skills like music, level design etc. If one AI can do all of that then I suspect it could do everything else in the world at which point we have AGI and the singularity. I wouldn&#39;t be too worried about programmers... I&#39;m more worried for the world as a whole.\n",

      "Comment: GPT doesn&#39;t possess cognition. I have utilized it in my own programming projects, and at times, it proves to be a better tool than Stack Overflow. However, it occasionally generates incorrect code and apologizes when you point out the mistake. Instead of providing the correct version, it continues to offer additional incorrect suggestions, resulting in an infinite loop of erroneous recommendations. It amuses me when people claim that these issues will be resolved in future versions of GPT. In reality, such problems are inherent  to large and matured language models and cannot be completely eliminated unless a revolutionary alternative emerges. Ultimately, when GPT fails, I find myself turning to Stack Overflow to seek human feedback. in simple terms, What GPT creates looks only impressive to the untrained eye and mediocre programmer like me.\n",
